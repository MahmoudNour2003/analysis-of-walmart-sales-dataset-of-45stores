# Retail Analysis with Walmart Data

This report discusses retail analysis with Walmart data covering sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01 using Python. The process will be as follows:

1. **Importing Data:** Importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform data analysis, calculations, and visualization.
   
2. **Displaying Data:** Displaying the dataset to get an overview of its structure and contents.

3. **Visualizing Quantitative Variables Distributions:** Visualizing data distributions to gain insights into the dataset.

4. **Performing Data Cleaning:** Performing data cleaning operations to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis.

## Importing Data

We import required packages such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to facilitate data manipulation, calculations, and visualization.

## Displaying Data

We display the dataset to understand its structure and content.

## Visualizing Quantitative Variables Distributions

We visualize the distributions of quantitative variables to gain insights into the dataset.

## Performing Data Cleaning

Upon inspection, the dataset appears to be clean with no rows containing missing values.

### Calculations

We perform several calculations on the dataset:

- **Identifying Store with Maximum Sales:** We identify the store with the highest sales.
- **Identifying Store with Maximum Standard Deviation:** We identify the store with the maximum standard deviation of sales.
- **Calculating Mean Sales of Non-Holiday Weeks:** We calculate the mean sales value of weeks without holidays.
- **Finding Holidays with Higher Sales Than Mean Non-Holiday Sales:** We identify holidays with sales higher than the mean sales during non-holiday weeks for all stores combined.

### Monthly and Semester View of Sales

We provide a view of sales in units on a monthly and semester basis.

### Visualization

We create various visualizations to explore relationships within the data:

- Scatter plot between Weekly Sales and Stores.
- Graphs depicting Unemployment, CPI, Fuel Price, Temperature, and Holiday Flag against Weekly Sales.
- Heatmap showing correlations between Weekly Sales and other numeric variables.

This summary covers our analysis of retail data using Python with Walmart dataset. We hope this report meets all requirements. Thank you for your attention.
